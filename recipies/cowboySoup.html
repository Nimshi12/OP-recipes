      Cowboy soup is a hearty, flavorful dish often made with a variety of
      ingredients like ground beef, beans, vegetables (such as corn, tomatoes,
      and onions), and spices. It's a comforting, filling soup that combines
      protein, fiber, and vegetables in a rich broth. Sometimes it’s enhanced
      with ingredients like potatoes, chili, or cheese. This dish is perfect for
      a filling meal, especially on colder days, and is a favorite for
      gatherings or family dinners.
