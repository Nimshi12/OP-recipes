        Cowboy soup is a hearty, flavorful dish often made with a variety of
        ingredients like ground beef, beans, vegetables (such as corn, tomatoes,
        and onions), and spices. It's a comforting, filling soup that combines
        protein, fiber, and vegetables in a rich broth. Sometimes it’s enhanced
        with ingredients like potatoes, chili, or cheese. This dish is perfect for
        a filling meal, especially on colder days, and is a favorite for
        gatherings or family dinners.
